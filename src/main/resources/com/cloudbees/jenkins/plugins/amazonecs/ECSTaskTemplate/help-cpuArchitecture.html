This parameter is required for Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate.  See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#runtime-platform" target="_blank">Runtime platform</a> for more details.</br>
</br>
When you register a task definition, you specify the CPU architecture. The valid values are X86_64 and ARM64.
</br>
When you have Linux tasks for either the Fargate launch type, or the EC2 launch type, you can set the value to ARM64.
</br>
For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-arm64.html" target="_blank">Working with 64-bit ARM workloads on Amazon ECS.</a></br>
